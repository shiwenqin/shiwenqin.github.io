I am a first-year PhD student at the School of Engineering in the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr. Elliot J. Crowley and Dr. Shay Cohen. I am a member of the BayesWatch group.

My research focuses on the efficient training of Large Language Models.

Previously, I received my First Class MSci degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from King's College London.
