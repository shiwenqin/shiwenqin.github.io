I am a first-year PhD student at the School of Engineering in the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Dr. Elliot J. Crowley](https://elliotjcrowley.github.io/) and [Dr. Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/). I am a member of the [BayesWatch group](https://www.bayeswatch.com/).

My research focuses on the efficient training of Large Language Models.

Previously, I received my First Class MSci degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from King's College London.
